    <h2>1Cademy</h2>
    <h3>A collaborative online platform for researchers and academics to share their work.</h3>

    <h4>Project Overview </h4>

    <h5>Timeline:</h5>
    <p> The user research and redesign of 1Cademy is still ongoing, and I worked on this project from June to August of 2020.</p><br>

    <h5>Role:</h5>
    <p>User experience designer on a team of researchers, designers, and developers </p><br>

    <h5>Tools:</h5>
    <p>Figma, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet</p><br>

    <h5>Team:</h5>
    <p>Undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students from the University of Michigan</p>

    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a need arose for researchers to collaborate virtually on a larger scale than before. 1Cademy, a tool that was originally intended for students to combine their learning efforts, was well-suited to allow researchers to share their work globally. The platform had never been used on this large scale before so it was necessary to conduct research and redesign certain aspects of 1Cademy to facilitate easier collaboration. </p>

    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>UX researchers on the 1Cademy team attended weekly journal club meetings to observe interactions between researchers using 1Cademy to share their findings. The 1Cademy team was clearly divided into researchers and designers, so I was not directly involved in conducting research. The design team was able to better understand the users of 1Cademy as a result of findings from the research team, and these findings led to a research-based redesign of the platform. </p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>The task of the design team was to improve the platform so that researchers could have a way to conduct research collaboratively. Our team did everything from redesigning the logo of 1Cademy to implementing new design features. Along with one other designer, Shannon Kenny, I specifically worked on the creation of a “presentation mode” that would allow researchers to present their work during weekly meetings. UX researchers had found that in order to share what they had done, COVID-19 researchers would simply scroll around the map to different nodes and zoom in to allow others to read the text.</p><br>
    <p>Previously, researchers would have to scroll around manually to show different nodes they wanted to present. We wanted to simplify this process and allow users to easily create a presentation and present their data. We designed a process where users can preselect nodes they want to present and save these nodes as a presentation, as shown in the interfaces below. </p>

    <p>After users have created and saved their presentation, they can use the interfaces below to present their data during meetings. This presentation format highlights the node that is currently being presented so that the presenter and viewers aren't distracted by other information. It also allows the presenter to easily switch between nodes as they are presenting.</p>

    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    <p>I really enjoyed working with a large team on this project and it was great to see collaboration between researchers, designers, and developers. Our team would come together weekly to make group decisions on design proposals, and I learned a lot about working on a team where everyone was completing different tasks. I'd like to give credit to my team member Shannon for her work on the presentation designs and to the entire 1Cademy design team for their great work to facilitate COVID-19 research.</p>
